# Computer-vision-tasks-for-identification-of-2D-semiconductors
Three deep-learning architectures DenseNet, U-Net, and Mask-RCNN on three computer vision tasks(multi-label classification, segmentation, and detection) were applied for the identification of two-dimensional(2D) semiconductors using the augmented microscopic images with different optical contrast variations which is the key information for atomic layer identification. Three deep learning models were trained and evaluated to identify mono-, bi-, tri-, multi-layer and bulk flakes using microscopic images of MoS2 fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrate by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
